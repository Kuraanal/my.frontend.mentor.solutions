# The challenge

The challenge is to build out this bar chart component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

#### The users should be able to:


- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day's bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Bonus: See dynamically generated bars based on the data provided in the local JSON file


#### Built with

- HTML 5 / CSS
- Vanilla JS
- BEM

#### What I learned

Through this project, I learned how to implement responsive layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox, manage dynamic data rendering with JavaScript, and apply BEM methodology for maintainable CSS. I also improved my skills in creating interactive charts and handling hover states for better user experience.

#### Useful resources
